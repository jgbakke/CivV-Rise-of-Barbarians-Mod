## Civilization V: Rise of Barbarians

**Canceled**

I have decided to cancel the development of this mod. This is because Rhye's and Fall of Civilization is coming to Civilization V, and this was going to be very similar to that.

I am leaving this up because it is a good reference and has example code that can be used to learn or review the Civ V Lua API methods.

**Background**

This is a mod for the game Civilization V. The goal of this mod is to make a more historically accurate and challenging game. The core concept of this mod is to recreate the rise and fall of civilizations throughout history.

Over time, new civilizations will spawn at their realistic spawn date. All barbarians within a certain radius of this civilization are part of the new civ. They are considered to have civilized and are now forming their civilization.

Barbarians will capture or raze cities now. If they capture a city and a new civilization spawns nearby, the city will be part of the new civilization.

Empires must now maintaint **stability**. Stability has a complex formula which is described in more depth in game but comes down to happiness, amount of social policies, how long you have been at war, and how many cities you have recently lost. If your stability goes to low, your cities might **revolt**. They will flip to either barbarian or form a new city-state and you will automatically be at war with them.

By adding these concepts, the game will be more realistic. New civilizations will rise up to destroy old and overexpanded civilizations. This way, you can recreate historical situations such as the Fall of the Roman Empire, the American Revolution, or experience your own situations. You can play as an ancient civilization to try to stand the test of time, or spawn in as a new one and rise to victory.

## Credits

Thanks to the Historical Spawn Dates, Civ Names by Policies, and Barbarians Evolved Mods.

I made some changes to each of those to make certain parts of this possible. That is why they are included in this repo. I added some new functionality to each of those, so if you use their most recent version it will not work
